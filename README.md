# 📊 STA 363 — Intro to Statistical Modeling  
### *Course Work & Projects by Natalie Sawtelle*

Welcome! This repository contains my work for **STA 363: Intro to Statistical Modeling**, a hands-on statistics course focused on building real-world statistical analysis skills through R, regression modeling, and experimental design.

Throughout the semester, I’ll be uploading assignments, reports, and code written in **R** and **RMarkdown**, following the topics outlined in the course syllabus. This repo highlights my progress in data analysis, model interpretation, and communicating insights effectively.

## ⭐ Course Overview

**STA 363** is an applied statistics course that emphasizes:

- 🔹 Working with data in R & RStudio  
- 🔹 Experimental Design (DOE), ANOVA, blocking, repeated measures  
- 🔹 Multiple regression and model building  
- 🔹 Residual diagnostics and model validation  
- 🔹 Logistic & Poisson regression  
- 🔹 Producing reproducible analysis in RMarkdown  

The course bridges statistical thinking with practical computational skills, preparing students for upper-level coursework and real-world data work.
